I'm walking on the road on a starry night. Suddenly I see a shop that offers
tea, coffee and light snacks. A bookstore next to it. I ponder what to do next.
Coffee smells good, and I like books. There are a few people here and there. A 
girl is playing a musical instrument on the side. Few groups of 3 - 5 people 
chatting in the background. Someone is playing with skateboards. A biker 
wearing a red scarf suddenly passes by. Few people have headphones on, few 
people are reading books. Nice weather. Sci - fi, futuristic, photorealistic, 
clay painting.

I told Midjourney to imagine based on the story above. The image above
<sup>[view on MJ](https://www.midjourney.com/app/jobs/f86e4d0b-ba5a-464e-8948-3198d64012ad/)</sup>
captures the mode I wanted to see. Some other results I liked:

<div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-3">
{% include an-img.html

cap="view on MJ" 
%}
</div>

I tried a variation, with "3d" as the suffix instead of "clay painting". Select
result below:

<div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-3">
{% include an-img.html 
src="https://cdn.midjourney.com/7ed7eb6a-ef07-4249-87b3-3e5b58ae7e8e/0_1.png"

</div>

It wasn't my intention, but looks like the moden hooked the style to Vincent
van Gogh's famous painting [The Starry Night](The Starry Night).
