AI imagines the story of little red riding hood from different angles. Starting
with AI retelling the story and then generating images based on it.

## Retelling the story

I started by asking ChatGPT to:

```
Tell the story of little red riding hood in Japanese setting
```

<details>
  <summary>ChatGPT generated a story titled: Little Red Kimono Hood</summary>
  <blockquote>
  <h4>Little Red Kimono Hood</h4>
  In a picturesque village nestled between the mountains and forests of ancient
  Japan, there lived a young girl named Akane. Known for her vibrant red kimono,
  she was fondly called "Akai Kimono no Akane" (Akane of the Red Kimono) by the
  villagers.
  <br/>
  Akane lived with her mother near the bamboo forests. One day, her mother asked
  her to deliver some fresh mochi and tea to her grandmother, who lived across
  the forest in a traditional Japanese house, or 'minka'. "Remember, Akane," her
  mother cautioned, "stay on the path and do not talk to strangers."
  <br/>
  But as Akane wandered through the forest, admiring the cherry blossoms and
  listening to the distant sound of a koto, she was approached by a cunning
  kitsune (fox) disguised as a wandering samurai. Entranced by her red kimono,
  the kitsune struck up a conversation and learned of Akane's destination.
  Offering a supposedly shorter route to the grandmother's house, the kitsune
  sent Akane on a wild goose chase, making her wander deeper into the forest.
  <br/>
  Swiftly, the kitsune reached the grandmother's minka and, using its magical
  abilities, locked the old woman in the storehouse. The fox then disguised
  itself as the grandmother and waited for Akane.
  <br/>
  When Akane finally arrived, she immediately sensed something was amiss.
  "Obāsan," she said, "why are your eyes so sharp?" The kitsune, improvising,
  replied, "All the better to see you with, my dear." Growing suspicious, Akane
  further questioned, "And why are your teeth so long?" To which the kitsune
  responded, "All the better to eat this delicious mochi you've brought!"
  <br/>
  Just as the kitsune was about to reveal its true form and pounce, a loud noise
  echoed through the minka. The village's renowned onmyoji (a spiritual master)
  had been passing by and sensed the mischievous presence of the kitsune. Using
  his spiritual abilities, he quickly subdued the kitsune and rescued both Akane
  and her grandmother.
  <br/>
  The story of "Akai Kimono no Akane" became legendary in the village, a
  reminder for children to always heed the advice of their elders and to be wary
  of the enchanting mysteries of the forest.
  <br/>
  And as for the kitsune? It was said that the onmyoji had transformed it into a   protective guardian statue, forever watching over the village, ensuring that
  no harm would come to its residents again.
