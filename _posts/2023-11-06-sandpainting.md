Envision a charming watercolor-inspired SVG illustration for a professional graphic artist's portfolio, showcasing a small chipmunk and a 7-year-old boy collaboratively creating a sandpainting. The boy, with a look of concentration and joy, gently guides the chipmunk as it uses its tiny paws to sprinkle colored sands onto the ground. The background is filled with soft, watercolor washes that suggest a sunny, outdoor setting, perhaps in a park or a backyard. The sandpainting they are creating should be a simple yet colorful pattern, suitable for their combined skill levels. Attention should be paid to the texture of the sand, the watercolor effects, and the interaction between the child and the chipmunk, capturing the innocence and creativity of the moment." %}

Illustrate a hyper-realistic 4K quality sandpainting that depicts dried banana slices scattered on a white background. The image should be so detailed and clear that each individual banana slice can be discerned, with the textures of the dried fruit and the sand granules carefully rendered to mimic a high-quality photograph. The white background should accentuate the golden hues of the banana slices and the subtle shadows they cast, creating a contrast that highlights the realism of the scene. The sandpainting should be created with such precision that viewers can almost feel the crispiness of the dried bananas just by looking at the artwork.
