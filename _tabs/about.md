Hi!  
I'm **[Sadh](https://nafsadh.com)** and **[`:art/if:`](https://ai.nafsadh.art)**
is a canvas for me to share artifical intelligence aided art imaginations.

### etymology

**`:art/if:`**, pronounced "artif", is a wordplay, symbolizing the intersection
of art and artificial intelligence. It can mean:

* **artifical art** - juxtaposing "artif" part from "artificial" with "art if, one
  can call it so".
* **artificer** - [artif.](https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/artif) 
  is an abbreviation of [artificer](https://m-w.com/dictionary/artificer); which 
  means: "a skilled or artistic worker or craftsman".  
* **creating conversation** - the `:` on both end of the name, indicates an open
  open ended conversation between image generation models and humans.   

### merging pixels and imagination

`:art/if:` represents a new chapter in my artistic journey, blending artificial intelligence with creative expression. Here, technology and art converge,
creating a space where imaginative creations are enhanced and transformed by the
capabilities of AI.

While the artworks here are influenced by artificial intelligence, my 
exploration in the realm of art is not new. My previous creations, spanning 
digital art to traditional paintings, can be explored at [nafsadh.art
](https://nafsadh.art). This platform, `:art/if:` is an extension of that 
journey exploring what becomes possible when technology becomes a tool in the 
artist's palette.
